# AuditKazoo

This repo's main goal is to enable developers to run some integration tests for [kazoo](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo) and its family applications.

If you want to write tests for the [monster-UI](https://github.com/2600hz/monster-ui), take a look at the [wallaby](https://github.com/elixir-wallaby/wallaby) documentation, it shows what you can do with the library.

This repo also provides a client consumer for Kazoo's API.
